Office hours will be held in the same place as last week, the Digital Scholarship Commons in the back of the ground floor of Hillman Library.

If none of these times for for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.

## Github! :tada:

If you didn't make a GitHub account already, do that super quick right now _because_:

This week we will be applying some of our command-line knowledge to learn how to use `git`! The format for today is the same as last week: follow along with me in your lecture notebook. Then, at the end, I'll explain your group project assignment!

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 6` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the Friday after your next lab session. You'll be submitting your GitHub repo!

To submit: copy the URL of your repo and submit it to Canvas. Each group member needs to do this.
